My data set includes general information about movies released between 1986 and 2016. The file stores the movie’s title,
 release year, score (out of ten), runtime (measured in minutes), genre, and rating. I wanted to use the information
 that would most help a person decide whether or not they would be interested in watching one of these films. I omitted
 all of the monetary values such budget, ticket sales, and gross. I chose to use movies for this project, because I love
  to watch them. My friends and I often go to the theaters whenever we have free time. I sorted the movies based on
  their score, so the user can see almost all of the movies from the past thirty years ranked from worst to best. I was
  excited to see that one of my favorite movies of all time, “The Dark Knight” was ranked number two overall!
